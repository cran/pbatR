Description: This R package provides power calculations via internal simulation methods. The package also provides a frontend to the now abandoned PBAT program (developed by Christoph Lange), and reads in the corresponding output and displays results and figures when appropriate. The license of this R package itself is GPL. However, to have the program interact with the PBAT program for some functionality of the R package, users must additionally obtain the PBAT program from Christoph Lange, and accept his license. Both the data analysis and power calculations have command line and graphical interfaces using tcltk.
